# RBBI for Go

This is a Go port of ICU4C's Rule-Based Break Iterator (RBBI), an algorithm
for extracting various types of breaks (character/grapheme cluster, line,
sentence, and word) from unicode strings. It supports both forward and reverse
iteration.

## How to use

Using the break iterater consists of two easy steps:

1. Instantiate a RBBI instance using one of the four constructors, e.g.
   `NewCharacterRBBI()` for character break detection.

2. Provide the break iterator with a struct implementing the Cursor interface.
   For iteration over simple strings the StringCursor struct can be used, and
   for more complex backing stores the interface can be implemented using e.g.
   a wrapper struct.

Of course, a simple code example is worth a thousand words:

    str := "the string to iterate over"
    cursor := rbbi.NewStringCursor(str)

    iter := rbbi.NewCharacterRBBI()
    iter.SetCursor(cursor)

    for {
        position, ok := iter.Next()

        if !ok {
            break
        }

        fmt.Println("Found a break at offset %v", position)
    }
